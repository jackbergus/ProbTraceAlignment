In order to assess our proposed approach, we perform the following experiments for empirically evaluating some of the properties of the proposed embedding strategy:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item First, we assess the degree of approximation introduced by the approximate-ranking approach if compared with the optimal-ranking. We observe that different embedding strategies provide a trade-off between ranking stability vs. precision (\S\ref{subsec:apprp}).
	\item Next, (\S\ref{subsec:gen}) \texttt{[Generalization: TODO]}
	\item Last, we evaluate the computational time required to both generate the embeddings and to assess the similarity between the embeddings. We observe that (\S\ref{subsec:efficio}).
\end{enumerate}
