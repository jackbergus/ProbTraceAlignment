\section{Conclusions and Future Works}\label{sec:conclusion}
We tackled the probabilistic trace alignment as a $k$NN problem.
%Conceptually, this requires to handle the two possibly contrasting forces of the cost of the alignment on the one hand and the
%likelihood of the model trace with respect to which the alignment is computed. We consider the important tradeoff between both
%aspects.
The approach balances between the likelihood of the aligned trace and the cost of the alignment by providing the top-k alignments instead of a single alignment as output. The experimentation shows that the approximated top-k ranking provides a good trade-off between accuracy and efficiency especially when the reference stochastic net generates several model traces.
Future works will investigate the probabilistic alignment over fuzzy-labeled nodes and declarative process models. Also, we will try to improve the performance (in terms of efficiency and accuracy) of the proposed approach by intervening both on the embedding and the algorithmic strategies.
